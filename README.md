# Decentralized Freelancing Platform

## Project Description

The Decentralized Freelancing Platform is a blockchain-based solution that connects freelancers and clients without intermediaries. Built on Ethereum using Solidity, this platform provides a trustless environment where clients can post projects, freelancers can apply and get hired, and payments are handled through smart contracts with built-in escrow functionality.

The platform eliminates traditional freelancing platform issues such as high fees, payment disputes, and lack of transparency by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and automated transactions.
